# Memora.Ui

## Purpose
Provides the local operator interface for Memora.

## Responsibilities
- project selection
- artifact browsing
- draft editing
- approval queue
- context inspection

## Does NOT contain
- lifecycle rules
- indexing logic

## Current Shell
- runs as a styled local ASP.NET Core shell
- reads workspace files through shared core and storage services
- uses a writable local copy of `samples/workspaces` unless `MemoraUi__WorkspacesRoot` or `MEMORA_WORKSPACES_ROOT` is set
- supports project selection, artifact browsing, draft editing, approval review previews, and a context viewer route

## Honest Scope
- draft edits write new draft revisions to the selected workspace root
- approval review surfaces are wired to current core diff and queue behavior
- approval and rejection persistence are intentionally not claimed in this slice

## Key Areas

- `Program.cs`: host wiring, default workspace root behavior, and route registration
- `Operator/LocalOperatorWorkspaceService.cs`: project, artifact, queue, edit, and review models for the operator shell
- `Rendering/OperatorShellPageRenderer.cs`: styled operator shell HTML rendering
- `ContextViewer/FileSystemContextViewerService.cs`: shared context-builder-backed viewer at `/context-viewer`

## Local Development
- the default development launch profile listens on `http://127.0.0.1:5080`
- run it alongside `Memora.Api` on `http://127.0.0.1:5081` to avoid local port collisions
- point `MemoraUi__WorkspacesRoot` or `MEMORA_WORKSPACES_ROOT` at the same workspace root when you want both hosts to inspect the same files
- if no workspace root is configured, the UI boots from a writable local copy of `samples/workspaces`
